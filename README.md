# Assignment_01
This repository contains scripts for creating a custom AMI to set up Jenkins on EC2 instances. The setup includes installing Java as a Jenkins dependency and configuring Caddy for SSL certificate installation and reverse proxy. Groovy scripts are used to create Jenkins users and install necessary plugins. Once the AMI is prepared, Terraform is used to create EC2 instances and configure the environment to access Jenkins at `https://jenkins.poojacloud24.pw`.
